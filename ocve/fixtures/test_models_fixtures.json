    "OCVE": "<p>The OCVE sources for Op. 38 consist of two manuscripts, three first editions, and several corrected reprints of one of the latter.</p><p>Both Chopin's autograph manuscript (<strong>A</strong>) and the copy thereof apparently prepared by Adolf Gutmann (<strong>CGut</strong>) were used as <em>Stichvorlagen</em>, the latter for the German first edition and the former for both the French and the English first editions.</p><p>The text of the French first edition was modified to a greater extent than that of the German or English prints. Three distinct stages in its evolution are represented by the OCVE sources: uncorrected proof (<strong>F0</strong>), first impression (<strong>F1</strong>), and definitive version (<strong>F2</strong>). In addition to these, there are three exemplars containing rare handwritten corrections: J&#281;drzejewicz score (<strong>J-F1</strong>), Stirling score (<strong>S-F2</strong>) and Dubois score (<strong>D-F2</strong>).</p><p>Two separate engravings of the German edition of Op. 38 were undertaken by Breitkopf & H&#228;rtel. The first edition (<strong>G</strong>) was not modified after its initial publication. The second edition, released around 1864, does not form part of the OCVE resource, nor the corrected reprint dating from c. 1872&#150;73.</p><p>To date, few copies have been located of the English first edition of Op. 38 (<strong>E</strong>), and this lack of documentation makes it impossible to trace the evolution of the edition after 1851. It is nevertheless likely that Ashdown & Parry corrected Op. 38 after acquiring Wessel's list in 1860, given that nearly all of the Wessel Chopin scores were revised by the successor firm.</p><p>The analysis of the sources for this work highlights the principal characteristics of each one.</p><p></p>",
    "analysis": "<p>The music text of <strong>F</strong> is confined to six pages which are densely laid out. In <strong>G</strong>, the same text fills nine pages, with as many as ten in <strong>E</strong>. Given these differences, the similarities between the layouts of the respective editions are very limited: indeed, only p. 8 (in toto) and the first system on p. 9 correspond to one another in <strong>G</strong> and <strong>E</strong>. </p><p>The publication process proposed for this work is as follows. <strong>G</strong> was based on a copy most likely prepared by Gutmann, which was corrected by Chopin before its dispatch to Leipzig. <strong>F</strong> and <strong>E</strong> were based on the same autograph manuscript, which is quite exceptional. The fact that Chopin allowed Troupenas to make his own arrangements with Wessel (see his letter to Julian Fontana of 23 April 1840) means that the existence of a third manuscript source can be more or less ruled out. It would appear that after using the manuscript to prepare the French proofs, Troupenas sent Chopin's autograph to London where it was used in turn by Wessel. Each edition was reviewed and corrected by its respective publisher prior to release; in both London and Leipzig, this was done by professional correctors, whereas in Paris Chopin himself would have participated in this process. As for the various corrections evident in the definitive version, their provenance is less certain: some musicologists doubt their authenticity and have attributed them not to the composer but to an unidentified professional corrector. CFEO reproduces the first known version of <strong>F</strong>, which forms part of the D&#233;p&#244;t l&#233;gal; this is generally regarded as an uncorrected proof. In view of the considerable differences between the three first editions, a passage of the work has been selected for comparative analysis, i.e. the coda in bs 169&#150;204 (pp. 10 & 11 in <strong>E</strong>).</p><p>The following features are exclusive to <strong>F</strong>:</p><ul><li>b. 169: no expressive or dynamic indications (i.e. no 'agitato' or '<em>f</em>')</li><li>b. 171: erroneous LH chord 1</li><li>b. 173: wedge staccato to LH chords 1 & 4;

    "generalinfo": "<p>Like the Scherzos and the Fantasy Op. 49, Chopin's four Ballades &#150; Opp. 23, 38, 47 and 52, respectively published in 1836, 1840, 1842 and 1843 &#150; belong to the most sophisticated and expressively potent works composed for piano during the romantic era. Claims that Mickiewicz's Ballades were their source of inspiration have been voiced almost from the moment they were finished, which explains the innumerable attempts of critics to find a poetic programme within each one. Even if their formal structures invite diverse interpretation, one discerns within each Ballade a sonata-derived framework freely developed by Chopin, sometimes in tandem with a theme-and-variations approach (Op. 52). It is noteworthy that all four Ballades are written in a compound duple metre (6/8) and that they derive much of their rhythmic impulse and, to some extent, character from the dance. In expressive language, however, they are extremely diverse, although each has a powerful narrative drive in which gentle and melancholic elements are ingeniously juxtaposed with often violent dramatic outbursts.</p>"
